**4. Cloud and Infrastructure Security:**

* **Shared Infrastructure:**
    * **Failure Description:**  FTX shared its cloud infrastructure and IT services across different entities (FTX.com, FTX.US, and Alameda) (Page 33), increasing the risk of a single point of failure and a wider impact from a security breach (Page 33).
    * **Remediation:**  Implement a policy for segregating business entities and their computing environments, with dedicated cloud accounts and network segmentation (Page 33). 
    * **Process:**  Develop a plan for migrating to separate cloud accounts for each business unit, ensuring appropriate security controls and access management.

* **Lack of Visibility Controls:**
    * **Failure Description:** FTX lacked robust logging systems, security monitoring tools, and real-time alerts for suspicious activity (Page 34), making it difficult to detect and respond to cyber threats (Page 34). 
    * **Remediation:**  Implement comprehensive visibility controls, including logging systems, security monitoring tools, and real-time alerts for suspicious activity.
    * **Process:**  Develop a system for collecting and analyzing logs, establishing alert thresholds, and responding promptly to potential threats.

    * **Failure Description:** FTX failed to properly secure application secrets (Page 35), such as passwords, API keys, and private keys, leaving them vulnerable to compromise (Page 36). 
    * **Remediation:** Implement a robust system for managing application secrets, including encryption, secure storage, and access control policies. 
    * **Process:**  Develop a secure process for generating, storing, and managing secrets, with clear authorization procedures and regular audits.

* **Lack of Code Integrity Controls:**
    * **Failure Description:**  FTX did not have sufficient code review processes, testing procedures, and security updates (Page 36), making their applications susceptible to vulnerabilities and attacks (Page 36).
    * **Remediation:**  Develop a secure process for managing software development and deployment, including code review, testing, regular security updates, and vulnerability scanning. 
    * **Process:** Implement a rigorous system for code review and testing, with a focus on continuous security testing and vulnerability mitigation.

**6. Debtorsâ€™ Work to Identify and Secure Crypto Assets in the Computing Environment:**

* **Lack of Documentation:**
    * **Failure Description:**  FTX lacked comprehensive documentation of crypto assets (Page 37), including private keys, seed phrases, and wallet details, making it challenging to track and recover those assets (Page 37).
    * **Remediation:**  Develop a comprehensive and well-maintained system for documenting all crypto assets, including private keys, seed phrases, and wallet details.
    * **Process:**  Implement a secure and centralized system for managing crypto asset records, ensuring accuracy, completeness, and easy access. 

* **Cybersecurity Incident Response:**
    * **Failure Description:** FTX lacked a comprehensive plan for responding to cybersecurity incidents (Page 37), making it difficult to contain the November 2022 cyberattack and mitigate further losses (Page 37).
    * **Remediation:**  Develop a comprehensive plan for responding to cybersecurity incidents, including steps for detection, containment, recovery, and post-incident analysis. 
    * **Process:**  Establish clear roles and responsibilities for incident response teams, including training and regular simulations.

* **Lack of Technical Capabilities:**
    * **Failure Description:** FTX lacked the technical capabilities to transfer assets to cold storage securely (Page 38), hindering their ability to mitigate risk and protect customer funds (Page 38). 
    * **Remediation:**  Invest in the necessary technology and expertise to securely transfer assets to cold storage, ensuring that the system is robust and reliable. 
    * **Process:**  Develop a standardized process for transferring assets to cold storage, including appropriate security protocols and documentation.

**V. Conclusion**

* **Key Findings:** The report highlights the severity of FTX's control failures (Page 39), leading to the loss of billions of dollars and exposing customers to significant risk (Page 39). 
* **Remediation Efforts:**  The Debtors are actively working to implement a range of remediation strategies to address these issues and recover as much of the lost assets as possible (Page 39). 
* **Ongoing Investigation:**  The report emphasizes the ongoing nature of the investigation (Page 39) and the potential for additional findings as the process progresses (Page 39).

**This detailed outline provides a clear understanding of the systemic control failures that contributed to the collapse of FTX (Page 1). By implementing the proposed remediation strategies, the crypto industry can learn valuable lessons from FTX's downfall (Page 1) and develop a more robust and secure environment for cryptocurrency exchanges and their customers (Page 1).**
