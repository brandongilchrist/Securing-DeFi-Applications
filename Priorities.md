## Securing a DeFi Startup: A Prioritization Plan for Limited Resources 

As Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of a new DeFi startup running a Decentralized Exchange (DEX), my top priority is to establish a foundation of secure practices that protect our users and our business while considering our limited resources. 
Here's a prioritization plan that a team of 4 can implement effectively, focusing on the most critical aspects:

**Key Principles:**

* **Prioritize:** Focus on the most critical assets and threats.
* **Minimize Attack Surface:**  Reduce the number of potential entry points for attackers. 
* **Layered Security:**  Implement a layered security approach to provide multiple lines of defense. 
* **Automation:**  Use automation to improve efficiency and reduce manual errors. 
* **Continuous Improvement:**  Regularly assess and update security measures. 

**This prioritization plan provides a structured approach for a new DeFi startup to establish a strong security posture with limited resources. By focusing on the most critical areas and implementing best practices, the team can build a secure and trustworthy foundation for its DEX, protecting its users and ensuring long-term success.**
